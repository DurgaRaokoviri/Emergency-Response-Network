Emergency-Response-Network
A fire breaks out in a residential area. A resident reports the emergency via a mobile app. The request is received by the backend and logged into the database. The system identifies the nearest fire stations and available fire trucks. Responders are notified with location tracking. Authorities receive live updates on the incident status.
